# PIC18F4620 Drivers with Layered Architecture

Welcome to the **PIC18F4620 Drivers** repository! This project contains fully functional drivers for the **PIC18F4620** microcontroller, built using a **layered architecture** approach. The aim is to provide clear separation of concerns, modularity, and maintainability, ensuring that the drivers are easy to extend and adapt to new requirements.

## Project Structure

The drivers are organized into multiple layers, each with a specific purpose, ensuring abstraction and clean separation between hardware interaction and application logic.

### Layers:
- **MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer)**: Handles direct interactions with the hardware, including register-level operations for peripherals like GPIO, Timer, UART, ADC, and more.
- **HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)**: Provides an abstraction of the hardware components, offering simple and reusable APIs for higher layers.
- **Service Layer**: Implements services that combine the functionality of HAL to offer complex features.
- **Application Layer**: The layer where the application logic resides, making use of the underlying services and hardware features.

## Features

- **Drivers Implemented**:
  - GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)
  - Timers
  - UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)
  - PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
  - ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter)
  - EEPROM

- **Layered Architecture** for better modularity and ease of maintenance.
- **PIC18F4620** specific drivers designed for flexibility and reusability.

## Why Use This Repository?

This repository demonstrates best practices in embedded software design, applying a layered architecture to organize the code into independent and reusable modules. By following this approach, you can:
- **Reduce complexity** in your project.
- **Easily maintain** and **extend** drivers and features.
- **Re-use** the drivers across different projects or with other PIC microcontrollers.
